# Frontend Mentor - QR code component

![Design preview for the QR code component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. It is my first challenge by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io). 

## The challenge

My challenge was to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
I used simple HTML and CSS and created a desktop and mobile version of the webpage.
